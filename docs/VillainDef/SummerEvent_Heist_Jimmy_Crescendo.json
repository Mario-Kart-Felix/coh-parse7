  "description": "Gambler and crooner, Jimmy Crescendo knows Ted Dubois from their days as military special forces.  Jimmy's experiences overseas changed him and he's had problems returning to civilian life.  Ted Dubois keeps him around the casino for those times when things get a bit dicey, though he's grown increasingly concerned with Jimmy's obsession with demonology and occult.  Ironically, Jimmy has the voice of an angel and keeps the ladies coming around on a nightly basis, but his dark temper and complete lack of humanity make him an ideal strong-arm for the casino.",
