  "description": "Joachim Matthias Reinhardt, an exchange student from Berlin, was obsessed with the dark matter that some Magic Origin heroes were able to channel into magnificent powers. Unwilling to tread down a mystical road himself, Joachim was determined to find a way to summon this dark matter through technology. Eventually, he created his \"Nano-Noir\" technology, which allowed small nannites within his body to store the dark matter and release it on demand. Of all Paragon City's heroes, Ravenstorm is the most solitary. Many find it surprising that he has formed such a close friendship with Moonfire, the Kheldian hero stationed on Striga Isle. But perhaps he considers her, like himself, alone in the world.",
