  "description": "Ouroboros' ability to time travel is entirely the work of the brilliant futurist, Mender Silos. He was the one who founded the group, brought its members back in time and is attempting to save everything. He is a stoic leader who seems to have the ability to look right through people as if they weren't there. The other members of Ouroboros say that this is because when Mender Silos looks a you he sees every 'when' you ever were and will be. Silos speaks little of his own time, only to say it is a cold, dark place where all that is living is too quickly burning out.",
