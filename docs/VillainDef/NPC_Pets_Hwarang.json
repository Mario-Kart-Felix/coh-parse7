  "description": "Kil-ja 'Kit' Sung is a young Korean-American who ignored her past for most of her life. She immersed herself in the modern age and all types of gadgets and technology. That all changed when she was visited by one of her ancestor spirits. Her ancestor Jun-tak, was a great warrior in his time and a master archer. Jun-tak explained that a time of great trouble must be met by all righteous warriors. He presented Kil-ja with a mystic bow of great power and sent her to Paragon City to carry on the grand tradition of her family. Kit has not fully accepted her role as Flower Knight, but between the advice of her ancestor, the power of his mystic bow, and her expertise with gadgets she is destined to be a mighty heroine in the City of Heroes.",
