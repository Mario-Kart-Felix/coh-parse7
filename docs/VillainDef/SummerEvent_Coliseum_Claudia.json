  "description": "A deadly bow priestess of Artemis, Claudia honors the gods through combat but she has gone restless with the constant demands of the Coliseum. She doesn't really think that Cornutus is blessed by the gods, but doesn't want to say anything for fear that it might upset her more pious sister Camilla. Claudia longs for the day when the gods will grow weary of the constant bloodshed and demand different homage from them but she doesn't expect it any time soon.",
