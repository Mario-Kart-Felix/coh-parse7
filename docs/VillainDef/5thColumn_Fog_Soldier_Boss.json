  "description": "To be commissioned an Oberst, or Colonel, a Nebel soldier must prove himself over the course of many battles. Many of them resent having to continue working with raw recruits, but this indignity is more than compensated for by their first taste of super soldier serums and body enhancements. Combined with their combat experience, these enhancements make them formidable foes.",
