  "description": "The swirling energies of the storm which has engulfed Penelope Yin's network node have created voids within the flow of energy. These voids have taken shape and can be moved around. When brought close to a Vortex, the two will combine to create an Eye of the Storm. This Eye of the Storm will suppress the storm's effects on those who stand in it and will allow Metronome's voice to reach Penelope, calming her and ending her untouchable state.",
